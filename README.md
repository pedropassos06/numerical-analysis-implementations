# numerical-analysis-implementations
This is a repository to keep all my implementations for Numerical Analysis methods. All the files are MatLab files.

You can find various different implementations such as Newton's method, Euler's method, and Gaussian quadrature. 
These implementations are important if you need to find accurate solutions to real-life problems where integrals, derivatives, and trivial root finding formulas can't be used.
